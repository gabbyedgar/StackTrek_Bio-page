Scenario
As a web developer, you often work on various projects and websites for clients. One of the essential elements of a well-designed website is a custom 404 Error Page that enhances user experience when visitors encounter a page not found error. You decide to create a reusable and customizable 404 Error Page template that you can easily incorporate into your future projects.

What the 404 Error Page Template Should Have
User-Friendly Message: Provide a clear and friendly message informing visitors that the page they are looking for cannot be found. Avoid using technical jargon and use simple language to communicate the error.

Apology and Empathy: Show empathy by apologizing for the inconvenience and let users know that you understand their frustration. Assure them that you are here to help.

Search Functionality: Include a search bar or a link to the search page to allow users to look for content they might be interested in.

Navigation Links: Provide links to relevant sections or popular pages on the website so visitors can easily navigate to other content.

Custom Illustration or Graphics: Add a customizable placeholder for a custom illustration or humorous image that matches the website's theme and personality. This will make the page visually engaging and easy to personalize for different projects.

Return to Homepage: Include a prominent button or link to redirect users back to the homepage. It's a good way to guide them back to familiar territory.

Contact Information: Offer a way for users to get in touch with the website owner or support team in case they have questions or need assistance. Provide a customizable email address or link to a contact page.

Error Code Display: Optionally, you can include the actual error code (404) on the page to help users understand the nature of the issue.
