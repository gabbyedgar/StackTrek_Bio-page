# StackTrek_Bio-page
Scenario
You are a web developer, and you have been tasked with creating a bio page for yourself. The goal is to introduce yourself to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. You want to showcase your skills, interests, and projects while having a visually appealing design inspired by the templates available at https://linktr.ee/s/templates/.

Requirements for Your Bio Page:
Profile Picture: Display a professional and friendly profile picture of yourself.

Short Bio: Create a section below the profile picture with a brief introduction about yourself, including your skills, interests, and a little background information.

Working Buttons or Links: Add at least five working buttons or links that lead to various important aspects of your work, such as your portfolio, projects, GitHub profile, resume/CV, and blog or any sites that may relate to you. You may use images for your links as well.

Social Media Links: Incorporate icons or buttons that link to your social media profiles, such as LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, personal blog, and any other relevant platforms.

Background: Use a visually appealing and complementary background that suits your personality and the overall theme of the page.

Additional Notes
Ensure that the page is fully responsive so that it looks great on different devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Use CSS creatively to style the page, drawing inspiration from the templates provided at https://linktr.ee/s/templates/. Pay attention to typography, color schemes, and spacing to create an aesthetically pleasing design.

Test the buttons and links thoroughly to ensure they are working correctly and lead to the intended destinations.

Consider adding subtle animations or hover effects to enhance user interaction and make the page more engaging.

Include any relevant projects, works, or achievements that you want to showcase.

Test the page in various web browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

Once you have completed your bio page, deploy it to GitHub Pages (github.io).
